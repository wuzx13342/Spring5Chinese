[[kotlin]]
= Kotlin

https://kotlinlang.org[Kotlin] is a statically-typed language targeting the JVM (and other platforms)
which allows writing concise and elegant code while providing very good
https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html[interoperability] with
existing libraries written in Java.

The Spring Framework provides first-class support for Kotlin that allows developers to write
Kotlin applications almost as if the Spring Framework was a native Kotlin framework.




[[kotlin-requirements]]
== Requirements

Spring Framework supports Kotlin 1.1+ and requires
https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter/org.jetbrains.kotlin%3Akotlin-stdlib[`kotlin-stdlib`]
(or one of its https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter/org.jetbrains.kotlin%3Akotlin-stdlib-jre7[`kotlin-stdlib-jre7`]
/ https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter/org.jetbrains.kotlin%3Akotlin-stdlib-jre8[`kotlin-stdlib-jre8`] variants)
and https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter/org.jetbrains.kotlin%3Akotlin-reflect[`kotlin-reflect`]
to be present on the classpath. They are provided by default if one bootstraps a Kotlin project on
https://start.spring.io/#!language=kotlin[start.spring.io].




[[kotlin-extensions]]
== Extensions

Kotlin https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html[extensions] provide the ability
to extend existing classes with additional functionality. The Spring Framework Kotlin APIs make
use of these extensions to add new Kotlin specific conveniences to existing Spring APIs.

{doc-root}/spring-framework/docs/{spring-version}/kdoc-api/spring-framework/[Spring Framework KDoc API] lists
and documents all the Kotlin extensions and DSLs available.

[NOTE]
====
Keep in mind that Kotlin extensions need to be imported to be used. This means
for example that the `GenericApplicationContext.registerBean` Kotlin extension
will only be available if `import org.springframework.context.support.registerBean` is imported.
That said, similar to static imports, an IDE should automatically suggest the import in most cases.
====

For example, https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/inline-functions.html#reified-type-parameters[Kotlin reified type parameters]
provide a workaround for JVM https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/erasure.html[generics type erasure],
and Spring Framework provides some extensions to take advantage of this feature.
This allows for a better Kotlin API `RestTemplate`, the new `WebClient` from Spring
WebFlux and for various other APIs.

[NOTE]
====
Other libraries like Reactor and Spring Data also provide Kotlin extensions
for their APIs, thus giving a better Kotlin development experience overall.
====

To retrieve a list of `Foo` objects in Java, one would normally write:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	Flux<User> users  = client.get().retrieve().bodyToFlux(User.class)
----

Whilst with Kotlin and Spring Framework extensions, one is able to write:

[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
	val users = client.get().retrieve().bodyToFlux<User>()
	// or (both are equivalent)
	val users : Flux<User> = client.get().retrieve().bodyToFlux()
----

As in Java, `users` in Kotlin is strongly typed, but Kotlin's clever type inference allows
for shorter syntax.




[[kotlin-null-safety]]
== Null-safety

One of Kotlin's key features is https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html[null-safety]
- which cleanly deals with `null` values at compile time rather than bumping into the famous
`NullPointerException` at runtime. This makes applications safer through nullability
declarations and expressing "value or no value" semantics without paying the cost of wrappers like `Optional`.
(Kotlin allows using functional constructs with nullable values; check out this
http://www.baeldung.com/kotlin-null-safety[comprehensive guide to Kotlin null-safety].)

Although Java does not allow one to express null-safety in its type-system, Spring Framework now
provides <<core#null-safety,null-safety of the whole Spring Framework API>>
via tooling-friendly annotations declared in the `org.springframework.lang` package.
By default, types from Java APIs used in Kotlin are recognized as
https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html#null-safety-and-platform-types[platform types]
for which null-checks are relaxed.
https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/jsr-305/proposals/jsr-305-custom-nullability-qualifiers.md[Kotlin support for JSR 305 annotations]
+ Spring nullability annotations provide null-safety for the whole Spring Framework API to Kotlin developers,
with the advantage of dealing with `null` related issues at compile time.

[NOTE]
====
Libraries like Reactor or Spring Data provide null-safe APIs leveraging this feature.
====

The JSR 305 checks can be configured by adding the `-Xjsr305` compiler flag with the following
options: `-Xjsr305={strict|warn|ignore}`.

For kotlin versions 1.1.50+, the default behavior is the same to `-Xjsr305=warn`.
The `strict` value is required to have Spring Framework API full null-safety taken in account
but should be considered experimental since Spring API nullability declaration could evolve
even between minor releases and more checks may be added in the future).

[NOTE]
====
Generic type arguments, varargs and array elements nullability are not supported yet,
but should be in an upcoming release, see https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/issues/79[this dicussion]
for up-to-date information.
====




[[kotlin-classes-interfaces]]
== Classes & Interfaces

Spring Framework supports various Kotlin constructs like instantiating Kotlin classes
via primary constructors, immutable classes data binding and function optional parameters
with default values.

Kotlin parameter names are recognized via a dedicated `KotlinReflectionParameterNameDiscoverer`
which allows finding interface method parameter names without requiring the Java 8 `-parameters`
compiler flag enabled during compilation.

https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin[Jackson Kotlin module] which is required
for serializing / deserializing JSON data is automatically registered when
found in the classpath and a warning message will be logged if Jackson and Kotlin are
detected without the Jackson Kotlin module present.

[NOTE]
====
As of Spring Boot 2.0, Jackson Kotlin module is automatically provided via the JSON starter.
====




[[kotlin-annotations]]
== Annotations

Spring Framework also takes advantage of https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html[Kotlin null-safety]
to determine if a HTTP parameter is required without having to explicitly
define the `required` attribute.  That means `@RequestParam name: String?` will be treated
as not required and conversely `@RequestParam name: String` as being required.
This feature is also supported on the Spring Messaging `@Header` annotation.

In a similar fashion, Spring bean injection with `@Autowired` or `@Inject` uses this information
to determine if a bean is required or not. `@Autowired lateinit var foo: Foo` implies that a bean
of type `Foo` must be registered in the application context while `@Autowired lateinit var foo: Foo?`
wonâ€™t raise an error if such bean does not exist.




[[kotlin-bean-definition-dsl]]
== Bean definition DSL

Spring Framework 5 introduces a new way to register beans in a functional way using lambdas
as an alternative to XML or JavaConfig (`@Configuration` and `@Bean`). In a nutshell,
it makes it possible to register beans with a lambda that acts as a `FactoryBean`.
This mechanism is very efficient as it does not require any reflection or CGLIB proxies.

In Java, one may for example write:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	GenericApplicationContext context = new GenericApplicationContext();
	context.registerBean(Foo.class);
	context.registerBean(Bar.class, () -> new Bar(context.getBean(Foo.class))
);
----

Whilst in Kotlin with reified type parameters and `GenericApplicationContext`
Kotlin extensions one can instead simply write:

[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
	val context = GenericApplicationContext().apply {
		registerBean<Foo>()
		registerBean { Bar(it.getBean<Foo>()) }
	}
----

In order to allow a more declarative approach and cleaner syntax, Spring Framework provides
a {doc-root}/spring-framework/docs/{spring-version}/kdoc-api/spring-framework/org.springframework.context.support/-bean-definition-dsl/[Kotlin bean definition DSL]
It declares an `ApplicationContextInitializer` via a clean declarative API
which enables one to deal with profiles and `Environment` for customizing
how beans are registered.

[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
	fun beans() = beans {
		bean<UserHandler>()
		bean<Routes>()
		bean<WebHandler>("webHandler") {
			RouterFunctions.toWebHandler(
				ref<Routes>().router(),
				HandlerStrategies.builder().viewResolver(ref()).build()
			)
		}
		bean("messageSource") {
			ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource().apply {
				setBasename("messages")
				setDefaultEncoding("UTF-8")
			}
		}
		bean {
			val prefix = "classpath:/templates/"
			val suffix = ".mustache"
			val loader = MustacheResourceTemplateLoader(prefix, suffix)
			MustacheViewResolver(Mustache.compiler().withLoader(loader)).apply {
				setPrefix(prefix)
				setSuffix(suffix)
			}
		}
		profile("foo") {
			bean<Foo>()
		}
	}
----

In this example, `bean<Routes>()` is using autowiring by constructor and `ref<Routes>()`
is a shortcut for `applicationContext.getBean(Routes::class.java)`.

This `beans()` function can then be used to register beans on the application context.

[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
	val context = GenericApplicationContext().apply {
		beans().initialize(this)
		refresh()
	}
----

[NOTE]
====
This DSL is programmatic, thus it allows custom registration logic of beans
via an `if` expression, a `for` loop or any other Kotlin constructs.
====

See https://github.com/sdeleuze/spring-kotlin-functional/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/functional/Beans.kt[spring-kotlin-functional beans declaration]
for a concrete example.

[NOTE]
====
Spring Boot is based on Java Config and
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/8115[does not provide specific support for functional bean definition yet],
but one can experimentally use functional bean definitions via Spring Boot's `ApplicationContextInitializer` support,
see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45935931/how-to-use-functional-bean-definition-kotlin-dsl-with-spring-boot-and-spring-w/46033685#46033685[this Stack Overflow answer]
for more details and up-to-date information.
====




[[kotlin-web]]
== Web



=== WebFlux Functional DSL

Spring Framework now comes with a
{doc-root}/spring-framework/docs/{spring-version}/kdoc-api/spring-framework/org.springframework.web.reactive.function.server/-router-function-dsl/[Kotlin routing DSL]
that allows one to leverage the <<web-reactive#webflux-fn,WebFlux functional
API>> for writing clean and idiomatic Kotlin code:

[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
	router {
		accept(TEXT_HTML).nest {
			GET("/") { ok().render("index") }
			GET("/sse") { ok().render("sse") }
			GET("/users", userHandler::findAllView)
		}
		"/api".nest {
			accept(APPLICATION_JSON).nest {
				GET("/users", userHandler::findAll)
			}
			accept(TEXT_EVENT_STREAM).nest {
				GET("/users", userHandler::stream)
			}
		}
		resources("/**", ClassPathResource("static/"))
	}
----

[NOTE]
====
This DSL is programmatic, thus it allows custom registration logic of beans
via an `if` expression, a `for` loop or any other Kotlin constructs. That can be useful when routes need to be registered
depending on dynamic data (for example, from a database).
====

See https://github.com/mixitconf/mixit/tree/bad6b92bce6193f9b3f696af9d416c276501dbf1/src/main/kotlin/mixit/web/routes[MiXiT project routes]
for a concrete example.



=== Kotlin Script templates

As of version 4.3, Spring Framework provides a
http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/script/ScriptTemplateView.html[ScriptTemplateView]
to render templates using script engines that supports
https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223[JSR-223].
Spring Framework 5 goes even further by extending this feature to WebFlux and supporting
https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-15064[i18n and nested templates].

Kotlin provides similar support and allows the rendering of Kotlin based templates, see
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/badde3a479a53e1dd0777dd1bd5b55cb1021cf9e[this commit] for details.

This enables some interesting use cases - like writing type-safe templates using
https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html[kotlinx.html] DSL or simply using Kotlin multiline `String` with interpolation.

This can allow one to write Kotlin templates with full autocompletion and
refactoring support in a supported IDE:

[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
	import io.spring.demo.*

	"""
	${include("header")}
	<h1>${i18n("title")}</h1>
	<ul>
	${users.joinToLine{ "<li>${i18n("user")} ${it.firstname} ${it.lastname}</li>" }}
	</ul>
	${include("footer")}
	"""
----

See https://github.com/sdeleuze/kotlin-script-templating[kotlin-script-templating] example
project for more details.




[[kotlin-spring-projects-in-kotlin]]
== Spring projects in Kotlin

This section provides focus on some specific hints and recommendations worth
knowing when developing Spring projects in Kotlin.



=== Final by default

By default, https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/classes-final-by-default/166[all classes in Kotlin are `final`].
The `open` modifier on a class is the opposite of Java's `final`: it allows others to
inherit from this class. This also applies to member functions, in that they need to be marked as `open` to
be overridden.

Whilst Kotlin's JVM-friendly design is generally frictionless with Spring,
this specific Kotlin feature can prevent the application from starting, if this fact is not taken in
consideration. This is because Spring beans are normally proxied by CGLIB
- such as `@Configuration` classes - which need to be inherited at runtime for technical reasons.
The workaround was to add an `open` keyword on each class and member
functions of Spring beans proxied by CGLIB such as `@Configuration` classes, which can
quickly become painful and is against the Kotlin principle of keeping code concise and predictable.

Fortunately, Kotlin now provides a
https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/compiler-plugins.html#kotlin-spring-compiler-plugin[`kotlin-spring`]
plugin, a preconfigured version of `kotlin-allopen` plugin that automatically opens classes
and their member functions for types annotated or meta-annotated with one of the following
annotations:

* `@Component`
* `@Async`
* `@Transactional`
* `@Cacheable`

Meta-annotations support means that types annotated with `@Configuration`, `@Controller`,
`@RestController`, `@Service` or `@Repository` are automatically opened since these
annotations are meta-annotated with `@Component`.

http://start.spring.io/#!language=kotlin[start.spring.io] enables it by default, so in practice
you will be able to write your Kotlin beans without any additional `open` keyword, like in Java.



=== Using immutable class instances for persistence

In Kotlin, it is very convenient and considered best practice to declare read-only properties
within the primary constructor, as in the following example:

[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
	class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)
----

You can optionally add https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html[the `data` keyword]
to make the compiler automatically derive the following members from all properties declared
in the primary constructor:

* equals()/hashCode() pair
* toString() of the form "User(name=John, age=42)"
* componentN() functions corresponding to the properties in their order of declaration
* copy() function

This allows for easy changes to individual properties even if `Person` properties are read-only:

[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
	data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)

	val jack = Person(name = "Jack", age = 1)
	val olderJack = jack.copy(age = 2)
----

Common persistence technologies such as JPA require a default constructor, preventing this
kind of design. Fortunately, there is now a workaround for this
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32038177/kotlin-with-jpa-default-constructor-hell["default constructor hell"]
since Kotlin provides a https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/compiler-plugins.html#kotlin-jpa-compiler-plugin[kotlin-jpa]
plugin which generates synthetic no-arg constructor for classes annotated with JPA annotations.

If you need to leverage this kind of mechanism for other persistence technologies, you can configure
the https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/compiler-plugins.html#how-to-use-no-arg-plugin[kotlin-noarg]
plugin.

[NOTE]
====
As of the Kay release train, Spring Data supports Kotlin immutable class instances and
does not require the `kotlin-noarg` plugin if the module leverages Spring Data object
mappings (like with MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, etc).
====



=== Injecting dependencies

Our recommendation is to try and favor constructor injection with `val` read-only (and non-nullable when possible)
https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/properties.html[properties].

[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
	@Component
	class YourBean(
		private val mongoTemplate: MongoTemplate,
		private val solrClient: SolrClient
	)
----

[NOTE]
====
As of Spring Framework 4.3, classes with a single constructor have their
parameters automatically autowired, that's why there is no need for an
explicit `@Autowired constructor` in the example shown above.
====

If one really needs to use field injection, use the `lateinit var` construct,
i.e.,

[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
	@Component
	class YourBean {

		@Autowired
		lateinit var mongoTemplate: MongoTemplate

		@Autowired
		lateinit var solrClient: SolrClient
	}
----



=== Injecting configuration properties

In Java, one can inject configuration properties using annotations like `@Value("${property}")`,
however in Kotlin `$` is a reserved character that is used for https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/idioms.html#string-interpolation[string interpolation].

Therefore, if one wishes to use the `@Value` annotation in Kotlin, the `$`
character will need to be escaped by writing `@Value("\${property}")`.

As an alternative, it is possible to customize the properties placeholder prefix by declaring
the following configuration beans:

[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
	@Bean
	fun propertyConfigurer() = PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer().apply {
		setPlaceholderPrefix("%{")
	}
----

Existing code (like Spring Boot actuators or `@LocalServerPort`) that uses the `${...}` syntax,
can be customised with configuration beans, like as follows:

[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
	@Bean
	fun kotlinPropertyConfigurer() = PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer().apply {
		setPlaceholderPrefix("%{")
		setIgnoreUnresolvablePlaceholders(true)
	}

	@Bean
	fun defaultPropertyConfigurer() = PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer()
----

[NOTE]
====
If Spring Boot is being used, then
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config-typesafe-configuration-properties[`@ConfigurationProperties`]
instead of `@Value` annotations can be used, but currently this only works with nullable `var`
properties (which is far from ideal) since immutable classes initialized by
constructors are not yet supported.
See these issues about https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/8762[`@ConfigurationProperties` binding for immutable POJOs]
and https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/1254[`@ConfigurationProperties` binding on interfaces]
for more details.
====



=== Annotation array attributes

Kotlin annotations are mostly similar to Java ones, but array attributes - which are
extensively used in Spring - behave differently. As explained in https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/annotations.html[Kotlin documentation]
unlike other attributes, the `value` attribute name can be omitted and when it is an array
attribute it is specified as a `vararg` parameter.

To understand what that means, let's take `@RequestMapping`, which is one
of the most widely used Spring annotations as an example. This Java annotation is declared as:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	public @interface RequestMapping {

		@AliasFor("path")
		String[] value() default {};

		@AliasFor("value")
		String[] path() default {};

		RequestMethod[] method() default {};

		// ...
	}
----

The typical use case for `@RequestMapping` is to map a handler method to a specific path
and method. In Java, it is possible to specify a single value for the
annotation array attribute and it will be automatically converted to an array.

That's why one can write
`@RequestMapping(value = "/foo", method = RequestMethod.GET)` or
`@RequestMapping(path = "/foo", method = RequestMethod.GET)`.

However, in Kotlin, one will have to write `@RequestMapping("/foo", method = arrayOf(RequestMethod.GET))`.
The variant using `path` is not recommended as it need to be written
`@RequestMapping(path = arrayOf("/foo"), method = arrayOf(RequestMethod.GET))`.

AppConfig workaround for this specific `method` attribute (the most common one) is to
use a shortcut annotation such as `@GetMapping` or `@PostMapping`, etc.

[NOTE]
====
Reminder: If the `@RequestMapping` `method` attribute is not specified,
all HTTP methods will be matched, not only the `GET` methods.
====

Improving the syntax and consistency of Kotlin annotation array attributes is discussed in
https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-11235[this Kotlin language design issue].



=== Testing


==== Per class lifecycle

Kotlin allows one to specify meaningful test function names between backticks,
and as of JUnit 5 Kotlin test classes can use the `@TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)`
annotation to enable a single instantiation of test classes which allows the use of `@BeforeAll` and `@AfterAll`
annotations on non-static methods, which is a good fit for Kotlin.

It is now possible to change the default behavior to `PER_CLASS` thanks to a
`junit-platform.properties` file with a
`junit.jupiter.testinstance.lifecycle.default = per_class` property.

[source]
----
class IntegrationTests {

  val application = Application(8181)
  val client = WebClient.create("http://localhost:8181")

  @BeforeAll
  fun beforeAll() {
    application.start()
  }

  @Test
  fun `Find all users on HTML page`() {
    client.get().uri("/users")
        .accept(TEXT_HTML)
        .retrieve()
        .bodyToMono<String>()
        .test()
        .expectNextMatches { it.contains("Foo") }
        .verifyComplete()
  }

  @AfterAll
  fun afterAll() {
    application.stop()
  }
}
----


==== Specification-like tests

It is possible to create specification-like tests with JUnit 5 and Kotlin.

[source]
----
class SpecificationLikeTests {

  @Nested
  @DisplayName("a calculator")
  inner class Calculator {
     val calculator = SampleCalculator()

     @Test
     fun `should return the result of adding the first number to the second number`() {
        val sum = calculator.sum(2, 4)
        assertEquals(6, sum)
     }

     @Test
     fun `should return the result of subtracting the second number from the first number`() {
        val subtract = calculator.subtract(4, 2)
        assertEquals(2, subtract)
     }
  }
}
----


[[kotlin-webtestclient-issue]]
==== `WebTestClient` type inference issue in Kotlin

`WebTestClient` is not usable yet in Kotlin due to a
https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-5464[type inference issue] which is
expected to be fixed as of Kotlin 1.3. You can watch
https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-16057[SPR-16057] for up-to-date information. Meanwhile,
the proposed alternative is to use directly `WebClient` with its Reactor and Spring Kotlin
extensions to perform integration tests on an embedded WebFlux server.




[[kotlin-getting-started]]
== Getting started



=== start.spring.io

The easiest way to start a new Spring Framework 5 project in Kotlin is to create a new Spring
Boot 2 project on https://start.spring.io/#!language=kotlin[start.spring.io].

It is also possible to create a standalone WebFlux project as described in
https://spring.io/blog/2017/08/01/spring-framework-5-kotlin-apis-the-functional-way[this blog post].



=== Choosing the web flavor

Spring Framework now comes with 2 different web stacks: <<web#mvc,Spring MVC>> and
<<web-reactive#spring-web-reactive,Spring WebFlux>>.

Spring WebFlux is recommended if one wants to create applications that will deal with latency,
long-lived connections, streaming scenarios or simply if one wants to use the web functional
Kotlin DSL.

For other use cases, especially if you are using blocking technologies like JPA, Spring
MVC and its annotation-based programming model is a perfectly valid and fully supported choice.
