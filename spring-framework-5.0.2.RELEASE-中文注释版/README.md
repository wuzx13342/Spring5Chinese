This is the home of the Spring Framework, the foundation for all
[Spring projects](https://spring.io/projects). Together the Spring Framework and the family of Spring projects make up what we call "Spring". 

Spring provides everything you need beyond the Java language to create enterprise
applications in a wide range of scenarios and architectures. Please read the
[Overview](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/overview.html#spring-introduction)
section in the reference for a more complete introduction.
